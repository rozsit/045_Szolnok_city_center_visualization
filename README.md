ðŸŽ‰ I'm excited to share my latest Python project: a map visualization of Szolnok city center, highlighting some of the most interesting Points of Interest (POIs)! ðŸŒŸ

This project showcases key elements such as buildings, parks, playgrounds, cafes, restaurants, schools, bus stops, parking areas, supermarkets, and museums. For data collection and processing, I used the OSMnx library, which is built on top of NetworkX and GeoPandas and interacts with OpenStreetMap APIs. This library was incredibly helpful in gathering and managing the data.
